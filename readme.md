# A collection of custom scripts

## SQL scripts

### sql_search_everywhere.sql
_Can be used in all MSSQL databases_
Searches every column in every table for the search term set in the variable **@Search_For**
Can be slow, but it will find everything


### sql_search_code.sql
_Can only be used in One Identity Manager databases_
Searches every column in an OneIM database that can contain VB.Net code or SQL code for the search term set in the variable **@keyword**.
You can limit the search results to only include custom objects or customized default objects by setting the variable **@onlyCustomObjects** to 1.

This was developed on 9.2.1, other versions might have tables or columns not included in this script. If you want to add them, you can use the statements in tools.sql to help you generate the required SQL.


### tools.sql
small helpers used to create sql_search_code.sql, because i am too lazy to type all that by hand
most of the lines were generated by the included statements, some were adapted manually (for example the ObjectName for DialogColumn objects also includes the table name)
